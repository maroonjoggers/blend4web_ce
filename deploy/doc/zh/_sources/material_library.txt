The material library is a library where a user can find basic and the
most commonly used materials to use in his or her projects or create
his or her own materials based on these materials.

The material library can be found in the "/blender/material_library/"
folder in the SDK root directory.


Library Structure
=================

All materials are structured by folder (by categories of materials)
and by a separate file (by materials). Every blend file contains one
base material and a material for an additional object, that
demonstrates the material on an object that can be associated with
this material (for example, a gold ingot for a gold material).

Material Structure
==================

[图片]

1. The core of the material

2. The "Material" node which receives all valuable information from
   the core.

3. The normal map that can be plugged into any material core.

4. Texture containing additional masks important for the material
   on the surface of the object to behave correctly. Most materials
   use the following masks:

      * Ambient occlusion map

      * Dirt map

      * Worn map

      * Patina map

      These masks are not used in every material, only when they are
      needed for the shader to appear a specific way.

5. The "Mapping" node is used to control the parameters of the UV
   maps.

6. The "RGB Curve" nodes can be used to correct masks before
   pulgging them into the material core.

7. Specific specular map settings are used right after the
   "Material" node to achieve various degrees of specular blur.

8. The baked ambient occlusion map is added to the shader right
   before the Output node.

9. The "Output" node.


Material Core
-------------

This is the main node group containing the node structure that form a
shader. Essentially, this is the material itself in its true form,
with all complex node interactions packed into one group for
convenient use. This node group has certain inputs and outputs, as
well as specific input parameters, to set it up.


An Example of Using a Material
------------------------------

[图片]

Here, you can see an example of setting plastic material for a special
demo object without using the textures that are plugged into the core
of the material.

[图片]

1. The base color is created with a simple "RGB" Color node and
   plugged to the material core input.

2. This implementation of the material does not use any normal
   maps, so geometry data is plugged to the "Normal" input.

3. The core of the material has a certain parameter that controls
   the amount of gloss on the material. In this case, the value of
   this parameter is set to maximum.

4. The material also uses a baked ambient occlusion map.

Now, let's take a look at a case of using the same material on a
different object — a plastic gamepad.

[图片]

1. The vertex color from the geometry of the object is used as the
   base color here.

2. A normal map has been baked for the geometry of the gamepad, and
   connected to the "Normal" input of the material core.

3. The level of gloss is lower.

4. Instead of the masks from the demo model, the masks (ambient
   occlusion and dirt) baked specifically for the gamepad model are
   used.

注解: It should be noted that the material core hasn't changed and
  was not altered to fit different geometry.


Adding Material to a Scene
==========================


How to Add a Whole Material
---------------------------

[图片]

Select the "File > Append/Link" from the menu, depending on what you
want to do. If you want to keep the ability to modify the object after
it has been added to the scene, use "Append". If you don't, use
"Link".

[图片]

Then select the blend file containing the material you need from the
"/blend4web/blender/material_library/" directory.

[图片]

Select the material itself from the list of materials, and press
"Append from Library" or "Link from Library". Now, the material has
been added to your scene and can be used on any object.


How to Add Only a Material Core
-------------------------------

If you want to add only the core of the material and set everything
else yourself, then, instead of selecting material, select "NodeTree"
while linking/appending, then select the node group you need, and
press "Append from Library" or "Link from Library".

[图片]

Now this node group can be found in the list of node groups that you
can add to your material by clicking **Add=>Group** in the Node Editor
interface.

[图片]

注解: Every material has its own requirements considering not only
  masks and textures, but also vertex colors and UV maps.


How to Add the Material Library to a Project
--------------------------------------------

When creating a new project, you can plug the material library into
it, and then plug in materials directly from there.

[图片]

To do this, check the "Use Material Library" box when creating the
project using the Project Manager. Then, an entire material library
will be automatically copied to the new project along with all the
dependencies.
