Blend4Web has several environmental effects that can be useful for
creating outdoor scenes.


Water
=====


Activation
----------

For the supposed water material activate the "Water" panel option
under the "Material" tab.

[图片]


Basic Settings
--------------

*Transparency*
   It is recommended to enable the gradient transparency (set the
   "Transparency > Type" parameter to the "Alpha Blend" value) and to
   tweak the "Alpha" value.

*Lighting parameters*
   Lighting parameters for the water material can be set up as
   described in the 灯光参数 section.


Waves Dynamics
--------------

Ripples on the water are simulated by normal maps with animated UVs
(from 0 up to 4 pieces). For normal map the only shared image is used
- the textures differs only by the "Mapping > Size" parameters. The
water mesh must have a UV layer.


Surface Wetting
---------------

Is carried out automatically. To turn the effect on activate the
"Wettable" option on the needed materials "Rendering Options" panel.


Reflection and Fresnel Effect
-----------------------------

For the water material both static and dynamic reflection is supported
as well as the Fresnel effect. See the 反射 section.

[图片]


Shoreline Smoothing
-------------------

The effect affects the water near the shoreline - it becomes more
transparent.

*Water > Shore Smoothing*
   Enable smoothing.

*Water > Absorb Factor*
   This is the light absorption coefficient for water. The higher it
   is the more transparent the water is. This value can vary from 0 to
   100. The default value is 6.


Color Gradient
--------------

For color gradient the water material must have a texture with the
"Export Options > Shore Distance Map" option enabled. This texture can
be generated using the script for baking shoreline parameters.

*Shallow Water > Color*
   This sets the color of shallow water. By default, blue (0.008,
   0.222, 0.8) is used.

*Shallow Water > Factor*
   This sets the mixing factor for the color of shallow water. This
   value can vary from 0 to 2, and is set to 1 by default.

*Shore Water > Color*
   This determines the color of the water just at the shore line. By
   default, dark blue (0.003, 0.19, 0.57) is used.

*Shore Water > Factor*
   This sets the mixing factor for the color of the water just near
   the shoreline. This value can vary from 0 to 2, and is set to 0.5
   by default.


Refraction
----------

Under the "Render" tab in the "Reflections and Refractions" panel set
the "Refractions" option to "ON" or "AUTO".

*Underwater Fog > Density*
   Exponential factor which affects the density and visibility
   distance. The default value is 0.06.

The god rays effect settings are also applied.

注解: The "Rendering Options > Backface Culling" option must be
  turned off for the correct water surface rendering.

   5000. Default value is 1000.


Baking Shoreline Data to Texture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the tools panel (hotkey “T”) under the "Blend4Web" tab open the
"Bake Shore Distance Map" panel. Set the parameters: maximum distance
to shore ("Maximum Distance") and the resulting texture size ("Texture
Size"). Select a landscape object (or multiple objects) first, and
then - a water object. Click the "Bake" button.

Depending on the texture size and the number of vertices in the
processed meshes the execution time of the script may vary from a
fraction of a second up to several minutes. Make sure that the texture
named "ShoreDistance" is created for the water mesh.

Upon script execution some system properties are saved in the water
material. Therefore, the scene must be saved after the script has
finished working.


Atmosphere
==========


Scattering
----------

Enable "World > Render Sky", then activate "Procedural Sky" panel
under the World tab. Please note, that if a static skydome texture is
being used at the same time, it will be replaced.

注解: Also, a procedural sky texture can be used to imitate
  scattered environment lighting similar to the static skydome
  texture. To do this, enable the "Procedural Sky > Use as Environment
  Lighting" and "Environment Lighting > Sky Texture" options. If the
  world texture for environment lighting already exists, it will be
  replaced.

   Base sky color. The default value is (0.087, 0.255, 0.6) (blue).

*Procedural Sky > Rayleigh Brightness*
   Rayleigh scattering brightness (i.e. scattering on small
   particles). The default value is 3.3.

*Procedural Sky > Mie Brightness*
   Mie scattering brightness (i.e. scattering on large particles). The
   default value is 0.1.

*Procedural Sky > Spot Brightness*
   Sun spot brightness. The default value is 20.0.

Fog
---

The engine supports standard parameters located on the "World > Mist"
panel. Besides this, overriding fog color is possible.

*Mist > Use Custom Color*
   Apply the user-defined fog color instead of "World > Horizon"
   color. Enabled by default.

*Mist > Color*
   Fog color. The default value is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) (gray).

When a dynamic skydome is used the fog color is defined by the sky
color.


Time of Day
-----------

Enable the "Dynamic Intensity" options for the lamp.

Time of day can be set by applications via API. Particularly time of
day can be set using the "Lighting" interface of the Scene viewer.

Stars
-----

Stars setup is described in the 光晕材质 section.

[图片]


Lens Flare
==========

[图片]

This feature can be enabled by the "Lens Flare" check-box located in
the "Rendering Options" of the "Material" panel.

[图片]

注解: The effect works only if a "Sun" type light source is present
  in the scene.


Lens Flare Settings
-------------------


Lens Flare Object
-----------------

[图片]

Lens Flare object is used for the actual rendering of the effect. In
essence, such an object consists of several planes with each plane
containing one element of the flare. The normal vector of each plane
should be pointed in the "-Y" direction. Every element can slide
across the screen in relation to camera rotation with the sole
exception being the central plane (bright white "star" on the picture
above). This plane serves as a center of the lens flare object and
should have a *local* "Y" coordinate set to 1.

The placement and spatial orientation of the object itself are not
taken into account during rendering.

For lens flare object to work correctly, the "Disable Frustum Culling"
option should be activated.

An example of such object can be seen, for example, in our **Island**
demo.


Material Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The material used for the lens flare object should have the "Alpha
Blend" transparency type. "Alpha" parameter should be set to zero.

Node materials are not supported.


Texture Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[图片]

An example of texture used to generate Lens Flare effect.

The texture used for the Lens Flare object should contain all elements
used to form the shape of the flare in an actual application. The
texture image should use "Alpha" channel and influence both "Color"
and "Alpha" values.


Wind
====

Wind strength and direction affect:
   * grass and tree leaves animation

   * particle system dynamics

   * water waves rolling frequency (at the moment only strength is
     taken into account)


Activation
----------

Add a force field object of the "Wind" type.


Setting up
----------

*Direction*
   Direction can be set by rotating the force field object.

*Force Fields > Strength*
   Wind strength. Located under the "Physics" tab. The default value
   is 1.0.


Animation of Grass and Tree Leaves
----------------------------------

Authoring resources for grass rendering is described in the Grass
section.
