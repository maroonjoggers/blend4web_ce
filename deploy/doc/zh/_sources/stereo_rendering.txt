立体渲染模式适用于使用特殊眼镜观看的内容。它是应用程序通过API来激活。

Blend4Web支持立体图像渲染的两种技术 -  立体图像（红/蓝）和HMD（头戴式
显示器）。

HMD：

HMD是一个实验性的功能，现在它只能用于 "Eye" 类型摄像机。


激活
====

To use HMD stereo rendering, you need to install Oculus's runtime
utility (two versions are supported: the *chromium_webvr_v1_win64.7z*
in the root directory and the one in the *Deprecated API* folder).
Windows and MacOS versions can be found on the Oculus website in
binary format, while Linux version should be compiled from the source
code.

For now, the HMD is supported by the Chromium experimental builds and
in the Firefox nightly builds.

HMD Settings
============

[图片]

This group of settings allows a user to change various parameters in
order to adjust whatever VR device they have to better view a certain
3D application or scene. There are two ways these settings can be
accessed:

Firstly, it can be found in the Blend4Web Viewer application under the
Stereo View tab.

And secondly, it can also be shown in an application by using the show
method of the hmd_conf module, but doing this requires some
programming. Examples of this method can be found in the "viewer.js"
and "webplayer.js" applications (in the "m_hmd_conf" object).


Profile
-------

This allows user to select a profile for a specific device. Currently,
the following profiles are available:

   * Custom

   * Cardboard (2014)

   * Cardboard (2015)

By default, *Custom* profile is selected.


Rendering Settings
------------------

*Tray to lens-center distance*
   This parameter specifies the distance between the phone frame and
   the center of the camera lenses.

   This value can vary from 0 to 50. Default value is 32.

*Interpupillary distance*
   This parameter specifies the distance between the pupils of the
   user's eyes. Measured in millimeters.

   This value can vary from 0 to 100. Default value is 64.

*Screen to lense distance*
   This specifies the distance between the screen of the phone and the
   camera lenses.

   This value can vary from 0 to 100. Default value is 50.

*Screen height*
   The height of the screen.

   This value can vary from 0 to 150. Default value is 63.

*Screen width*
   The width of the screen.

   This value can vary from 0 to 200. Default value is 107.

*Bevel width*
   The thickness of the border around the image.

   This value can vary from 0 to 20. Default value is 3.

*Distortion coefficients*
   This is used in order to compensate image distortion produced by
   the VR device lenses.

   Both values can vary from 0 to 1. Default values are 0.34 for the
   first parameter and 0.55 for the second one.


Other control tools
