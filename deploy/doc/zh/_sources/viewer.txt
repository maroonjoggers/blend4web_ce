Scenes
~~~~~~

在 "assets.json" 文件中的分类和场景的双级列表.


Tools & Debug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This panel contains a range of debugging tools, including:

*Overview Outlining Mode*
   Turning this option on makes all objects in the scene selectable
   and enables outline animation to be played upon selecting them.
   This feature is enabled by default.

*Auto View Mode*
   Pressing this button will cause Scene Viewer to load every scene
   from the "Scenes" list within one second of each other. This
   feature can be used to check all available content for console
   errors.

*Canvas Resolution Factor*
   This parameter can be used to increase the resolution of a canvas.
   The value can vary from 1 to 10. Default value is 1.0 (canvas
   resolution is equal to the physical resolution of the Scene Viewer
   window).

   注解: The highest available resolution of a canvas may be limited
     by a web browser.

*Make Screenshot*
   This button can be used to make screenshots of the Scene Viewer's
   window. Screenshots are stored in the same folder that web browsers
   use for storing downloaded files.

*Debug View Modes*
   The list of different rendering modes that can be used for debug
   purposes. Available modes are:

      "NONE" - normal rendering mode. This is the default mode.

      "OPAQUE WIREFRAME" - the scene is rendered in flat white color
      with darker wireframe. The color used for rendering the
      wireframe can be adjusted by using the "Wireframe Edge Color"
      parameter.

      "TRANSPARENT WIREFRAME" - the scene is rendered as in normal
      mode, but wireframes are added on top of it. Like in the
      previous mode, the color used for rendering the wireframe can be
      adjusted by using the "Wireframe Edge Color" parameter.

      "FRONT BACK VIEW" - renders front and back sides of the polygons
      with different colors.

      "BOUNDINGS" - this mode adds wireframe spheres that envelope
      objects and meshes. The spheres can be blue (for static
      objects/meshes) or red (for dynamic objects).

      "CLUSTER VIEW" - in this view mode, every object in a specific
      cluster (used for batching) is rendered with a specific color.

      "BATCH VIEW" - in this view mode, every batch is rendered using
      a specific (flat) color. The colors used in rendering can be
      changed to randomly generated colors by clicking the "Change
      Colors" button.

      "RENDER TIME" - the scene is rendered in different colors to
      represent the complexity of various parts of the scene. The
      lightest parts are rendered using shades of green, heavier -
      shades of orange, and the most resourse-demanding parts of the
      scene are colored red.

*Change Colors*
   This button randomly changes the colors that are used in the
   "CLUSTER VIEW" and "BATCH VIEW" rendering modes. This feature is
   useful in cases when colors that are picked randomly by the engine
   are too similar and make it difficult to distinguish parts of the
   image.

*Render Time Threshold (ms)*
   This parameter sets a "threshold" time for the "RENDER TIME" view
   mode. If the engine spends more time on rendering a certain object
   than the time set by this value, this object will be colored red.
   The default value is 1.5 ms.

*Wireframe Edge Color*
   This parameter allows you to change the color of the wireframe
   edges used in the "OPAQUE WIREFRAME" and "TRANSPARENT WIREFRAME"
   view modes.

*HUD Info*
   [图片]

   This button shows a list of rendered subscenes and its parameters,
   incuding:

      *SCENE*
         The name of the current scene.

      *Active*
         Shows whether the subscene is active or not.

      *Subscene*
         The name of the subscene.

      *Lamps*
         The number of light sources in the subscene.

      *Size*
         The size of the render of the subscene.

      *RenderCalls*
         The number of draw calls in the subscene.

      *Time*
         The amount of time the engine spends on rendering the
         subscene.

      *TOTAL ACTIVE*
         The number of draw calls in all present subscenes and the
         time that the engine spends on rendering them.

   Enabling this parameter may decrease performance of a scene. This
   option is disabled by default.

*GL Debug*
   This parameter, when activated, causes the engine to process low-
   level errors. This can significantly decrease performance. It is
   disabled when you start Scene Viewer for the first time, and
   afterwards, the application will save the state of this option for
   the next time.

*Min Capabilities Mode*
   This parameter makes Scene Viewer run a loaded scene as if it was
   running on a low-end system (on a mobile device, for example). This
   allows an artist to find out which materials in the scene may not
   work as intended with low-end configuration. Disabled by default.

2. **视维**

      这是位于左上角。它显示像素视口的尺寸。

3. **选定的物体和控制物体**

      这是位于左下角。它显示选择和控制对象的名称。对象选择可以用鼠标来
      执行。要直接控制的对象（通常为物理调试）按 "Q" 键并单击对象。物
      体的移动是与执行 "W", "A", "S", "D" 键。要退出控制模式下，按 "Q"
      键并单击一个空的空间。该指标也显示在Blender单位（米当量）所选对
      象的距离。

4. **场景复杂度指标**

      Is located in the top right corner of the rendering area. It
      displays the number of vertices, triangles, WebGL draw calls and
      shaders used in the main rendering scene (i.e. shadow rendering
      calls are not included, for example).

5. **显存指标**

      位于渲染区域的右下角。它显示视频存储器的使用的几何形状，纹理，渲

      console.

7. **Background Transparency Indicator**

      Is located in the top right corner of the screen, right below

      It appears as a small square with a black and white checkerboard
      pattern.

      This indicator is visible only when the background of the
      application is transparent. It is shown on the picture above
      only to give the reader the general idea of how it will look
      under real circumstances.
